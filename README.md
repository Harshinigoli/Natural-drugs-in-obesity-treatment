ABSTRACT
Background

Due to modern lifestyle changes, overweight and obesity has been the root cause of many chronic diseases and health problems. In this regard, natural products play a crucial role in pharmaceutical industries and their useful extracts are being incorporated in a lot of medicines nowadays for various therapeutic effects and lesser side effects. Recently, experimental studies have suggested the anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin which is a primary constituent of natural turmeric. Nano-particle formulation of curcumin is more preferred for its increased bioavailability as compared to curcumin which is very poorly bioavailable. In the present study, we have explored the long term efficiency of nano-curcumin as an anti-obesity therapeutic agent through a combined study of several parameters by examining its effect on body weight, blood parameters, liver weight, epididymal fat weight, and intestinal permeability measured through a 17 weeks study, in high fat diet induced obese mice models.

Methods

15 male Swiss Albino mice were divided into 3 groups of 5 animals each and were fed normal diet along with nano-curcumin treatment (ND+NC), high-fat diet along with nano-curcumin co-treatment (HFD+NC) and high fat diet followed by nano-curcumin co-treatment (HFDFND) respectively for a period of 17 weeks. Nano-curcumin treatment was given by oral gavage at the dose of 5.6 mg/ kg of mice body weight. Weekly assessments of body weight and blood parameters were carried out during the study. At the end of 17 weeks, the liver weight, epididymal fat weight and intestinal permeability was measured.

Results

Nano-curcumin treatment showed a marked reduction in body weight in high fat diet fed mice. It also showed a reduction in blood glucose, triglyceride, liver weight, epididymal fat weight, and intestinal permeability as well. No significant reduction in blood cholesterol was observed. Results demonstrated the protective role of nano-curcumin in preventing obesity in HFD+NC group. It also showed the reversal of obesity effects along with obesity prevention in HFDFND group mice.

Conclusion

These findings indicate the possible utilities of nano-curcumin as an anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic drug therapy.
